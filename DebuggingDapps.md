# Debugging Dapps

Requirements:

* [Crypti Sandbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypti-sandbox) - Version **1.0.3** and above.

**Important:** If you have installed the Crypti Sandbox module before (see **node_modules/crypti-sandbox**). Please check the version, it must be greater than or equal to 1.0.3. If you have an older version of Crypti sandbox, please run the following commands:

```sh
rm -rf node_modules/crypti-sandbox
npm install crypti-sandbox

Debugging is enabled by launching crypti with the **DEBUG** environment variable assgined with a value of **1**, for example:

```sh
DEBUG=1 node app.js
```

```sh
npm install -g node-inspector
```

Launch crypti:

```sh
DEBUG=1 node app.js
```
